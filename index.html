        <p>A fashion expo is a trade show where fashion designers, manufacturers, and retailers showcase their latest collections, trends, and products. These events provide a platform for businesses to connect, network, and find new partnerships. They are a key part of the fashion industry, driving innovation and business growth.
        A fashion show is an event put on by a fashion designer to showcase their upcoming line of clothing and/or accessories during a fashion week. Fashion shows debut every season, particularly the spring/summer and fall/winter seasons. This is where designers seek to promote their new fashions.
        A fashion expos, much like a trade show, is a venue where suppliers present their newest collections, setting the tone for the upcoming season. On the other side, buyers attend to gain an insightful overview of what's next in the world of fashion. </p>
